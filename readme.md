# LEGO® Pybricks Collection

A collection of Pybricks scripts I made, mainly for vehicles.

My first introduction to Pybricks was by an article on [RacingBrick](https://racingbrick.com/2021/08/remote-control-for-control-sets-without-an-app-or-smartphone-pybricks/). Most, if not all, of my vehicle related scripts find its roots from the scripts over there.
